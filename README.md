# Exercises

Just a bunch of programming exercises or challenges I've solved (or tried to)
in various languages.

## Contributing

The idea of this repository is to showcase my solutions to programming
problems, thus contributions adding new solutions won't be accepted.

That being said, you are more than welcome to improve my code or suggest new
problems. Keep in mind that, for this specific repository, I prefer things that
can be solved at best in a few hundred lines and without the need for external
libraries. This isn't, however, a hard rule, just a guideline that I may break
for interesting stuff.

And, if you do suggest a problem for me to solve, please credit its original
source.

## Licensing

This gets a bit tricky since this repository contains problems from various
sources; you may notice there is a LICENSE file, but that's for my code only,
not for the problems themselves. For those, please contact the authors or seek
their licensing information.

If any of the problems contains licensing information that differs from the
LICENSE file, please disregard it, as it was probably an oversight. Only the
LICENSE file is valid for whatever code is contained in this repository.

There may be original problems in this repository, and those are licensed under
the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License][CC-SA].
