Rainbow (also known as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow or Blackmore's Rainbow) are a
British rock band led by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, active from 1975 to 1984
and 1993 to 1997, and again since 2015. They were originally established with
Ronnie James Dio's American rock band Elf, but after the first album, Blackmore
fired the backing members and continued with Dio until 1979. Three British
musicians joined in 1979, singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey, former
Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, and this line-up gave the band their
commercial breakthrough with the single "Since You Been Gone". Over the years
Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring
the same line-up. Other lead singers Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White would
follow, and the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band's
early work primarily featured mystical lyrics with a neoclassical metal style,
but went in a more streamlined, commercial direction following Dio's departure
from the group.
